# hub.io
Hub.io is an aggregate of online streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, etc. This application will allow every user’s subscription services for online video streaming to be in one concise place. This service will help save time and keep everyone’s subscription services side by side for easy searchability and comparability. This will prevent users from having to switch out of certain streaming services to try to find a particular tv show or movie.

This project was initially started for our HCI class, however we enjoyed the project, so we decided to work on it further.

*Note: This is a GUI prototype, so functionality does not exist.*

###### (Currently only works in Google Chrome in Desktop, we are working on making it more flexible for multiple platforms).
